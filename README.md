#Â LED controller

Shitty LED controller which was some of the first code that I wrote. Do not use in anything remotely resembles production. A rewrite with a real time websockets replacement controlled with a full color-wheel was in progress.

You have to manually change all the addresses for your correct GPIO pins and temperate probe locations.
